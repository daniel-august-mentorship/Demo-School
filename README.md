Demo School

We will create a demo application together. In this demo, you will try to learn the basic concepts and apply it.


# Pages

> This is a work in progress. I will add the mockup as we go.
* Whenever possible, use the `components` already available in `react-bootstrap`.
* We will build this step by step, we will start by making the re-usable components.
* Let's schedule a call every week to go over what we did for the week.

## Homepage

* We will add an `Overview` section with 3 cards on the first row.
* We will add a `line chart` at the bottom left.
* We will add a `Roster` tavble on the bottom right.
